**About Cogs**

>Social - This cog gives the ability to interact with users through gifs and the bot. Commands like kiss, bite, spank, slap, feed ect. 

>RevImage - This cog gives the ability to reverse image search any file (weather you upload it or have the link) and display results within discord. with a link to data. 

>Bancheck - This cog gives the ability to check users against 2 global banlists on discord. Discord.Services and Discordlist.net. 

>Partnerapp - This cog allows a server to accept partnership applications

>Staffapp - This cog allows servers to accept staff applications

>Registration - This cog was created for servers that want to cut down on their self roles. This cog has roles for gender, area, age, and more. With one command [p]register the user is DMed by the bot and collects the information needed to assign several roles at once. 

>ImgWelcome - This is cog inspired by Bread-Cogs imgwelcome but made better. It welcomes the user with an image instead of text and runs a "security check" to tell 3 things. If their account is under 7 days old, and if they are listed on either of the gloabal banlists for Discord.Services or DiscordList.net
